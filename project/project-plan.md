## Title
AI and Unemployment in the Americas

## Main Question
Does the adoption of AI in various industries across the Americas contribute to job displacement, and if so, how significant is its impact on unemployment?

## Description
AI is transforming industries, potentially leading to job displacement in certain sectors. This project analyzes the correlation between AI adoption and unemployment rates in different regions and industries across the Americas. By examining patterns of AI integration and labor market changes, the project aims to provide insights into whether AI-driven automation is a significant factor in unemployment and which industries or regions are most affected.
