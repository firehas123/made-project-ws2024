## Title
Respiratory Health and Climate Quality in the Americas

## Main Question
Is there a significant relationship between climate quality indicators (such as air pollution levels) and respiratory health outcomes across different regions in the Americas?

## Description
This project investigates the correlation between climate quality factors—specifically air pollution—and respiratory health outcomes in various regions across the Americas. By examining data on air quality and respiratory illness rates, the project aims to determine if poor climate quality is a substantial contributor to respiratory health issues and to identify which regions are most affected.

## Data Sources

### Data Source 1: Climate Quality Data
- **Metadata URL:** [World Health Organization - Air Pollution Data](https://www.who.int/data/gho/air-pollution)
- **Data URL:** [WHO Global Health Observatory - Air Quality Indicators](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/air-pollution)
- **Data Type:** CSV, XLSX
- **Description:** This dataset provides information on air pollution indicators (PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, ozone) by region and country, enabling analysis of climate quality in relation to respiratory health trends.

### Data Source 2: Respiratory Health Data
- **Metadata URL:** [Global Health Data Exchange - Respiratory Health Indicators](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/)
- **Data URL:** [Global Health Data Exchange - Respiratory Conditions](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool)
- **Data Type:** CSV, XLSX
- **Description:** Provides data on respiratory health conditions, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) prevalence, hospitalizations, and mortality rates by region. This data supports analysis of respiratory health outcomes and their potential links to climate quality.
